    body: `So what is it exactly? Simply put, it's a method of wireless data transfer called NFC (Near field communication) that detects and then enables technology in close proximity to communicate without the need for an internet connection. It's easy, fast and works automagically.

    How does NFC work?
    The tech involved is deceptively simple: evolved from radio frequency identification (RFID) tech, an NFC chip operates as one part of a wireless link. Once it's activated by another chip, small amounts of data between the two devices can be transferred when held a few centimeters from each other.
    At its core, NFC works to identify us by our enabled cards and devices (and by extension, our bank accounts and other personal info.)

    How can I use NFC right now?
    NFC chips stocked inside credit cards for contactless payments are nothing new. But a slightly more recent - and admittedly more enticing - use case for NFC is with your smartphone, or even your smartwatch, as a way to digitize your entire wallet.

    Android Pay allows Android users to pay via NFC
    Virtually every mobile OS maker has their own apps that offer unique NFC functionality. Android users have the widest variety to choose from. The most well-known option is Android Pay, which works on many Android phones and watches, allowing you to access your funds for contactless payments. 

    Samsung Pay, which operates similarly, is available for Samsung phone users in the US, and expected to land in the UK soon.

    But NFC functionality on phones isn't limited to payments. There's also Android Beam, which was implemented way back in 2011 in Android Ice Cream Sandwich 4.0 as a nifty, simple process that allows for the transfer of photos, contacts and directions by holding two phones together.`

    body: `Dennis MacAlistair Ritchie (born 1941) is best known for his work on computer languages and operating systems ALTRAN, B, BCPL, C, Multics, and especially Unix. For a man who did not start out in the computer industry, he has had a profound influence on the entire computer programming world. He told Investor's Business Daily , "It's not the actual programming that's interesting. But it's what you can accomplish with the end results that are important." And if that is the case, then Ritchie has had an important effect on most, if not all, computer users today.
    Unix was written in machine language, which had a small vocabulary and did not deal well with multiple computers and their memories. So Ritchie combined some aspects of the older systems with aspects of the new one, and came up with the "C" programming language. In the early twenty-first century, "C" is still the dominant language of computer programming. It was such a simple, concise language that almost every single computer maker at the time switched to it.
    
    "C" uses very little syntax and few instructions, but it is extremely structured and modular. Because of this it was easy to use in different computers. There were large blocks of "C" functions that were already written that programmers could copy whole into their own programs without having to start from scratch, making it faster and easier to implement. These blocks were easily accessible, available in libraries so programmers could access them. By the middle of the 1980s "C" had become one of the most popular programming languages in the world. Because of the speed with which "C" could be used to write programs and run them, companies began using "C" to develop their own software.

    By 1973 Ritchie and Thompson had re-written the Unix operating system, using "C" instead of machine language, and had done massive testing on it. It was so simple to use that programmers all over were switching to smaller machines to do their programming, giving up the larger computers they thought they would never want to leave. Bell Labs became Lucent Technologies Inc., and began to sell Unix to developers, creating a whole new division for the company. Ritchie has credited his success in part to the fact that he did not have a computer background and therefore had an open mind to possibilities that others might not have thought existed.`

  Debating: {

    body: `The Basic Debating Skills: 
    Style is the manner in which you communicate your arguments. This is the most basic part of debating to master. Content and strategy are worth little unless you deliver your material in a confident and persuasive way.
    
    Speed,
    It is vital to talk at a pace which is fast enough to sound intelligent and allow you time to say what you want, but slow enough to be easily understood.
    
    Tone,
    Varying tone is what makes you sound interesting. Listening to one tone for an entire presentation is boring.
    
    Volume,
    Speaking quite loudly is sometimes a necessity, but it is by no means necessary to shout through every debate regardless of context. There is absolutely no need speak any more loudly than the volume at which everyone in the room can comfortably hear you. Shouting does not win debates. Speaking too quietly is clearly disastrous since no one will be able to hear you.
    
    Clarity,
    The ability to concisely and clearly express complex issues is what debating is all about. The main reason people begin to sound unclear is usually because they lose the “stream of thought” which is keeping them going. It is also important to keep it simple. While long words may make you sound clever, they may also make you incomprehensible.
    
    Use of notes and eye contact,
    Notes are essential, but they must be brief and well organized to be effective. There is absolutely no point in trying to speak without notes. Of course, notes should never become obtrusive and damage your contact with the audience, nor should they ever be read from verbatim. Most people sketch out the main headings of their speech, with brief notes under each.
    When writing notes for rebuttal during the debate, it is usually better to use a separate sheet of paper so you can take down the details of what the other speakers have said and then transfer a rough outline onto the notes you will actually be using.
    Eye contact with the audience is very important, but keep shifting your gaze. No one likes to be stared at.
    
    Content,
    Content is what you actually say in the debate. The arguments used to develop your own side’s case and rebut the opposite side’s. The information on content provided below is a general overview of what will be expected when you debate. The final logistics of how long you will be debating, how many people will be in your group, and how the debate will unfold (ie: which team speaks first etc.), will all be decided by your tutorial leader.`

  Sterotypes: {

    title: 'Sterotypes',
    image: 'stereotypes.jpg',
    body: `Definition: A stereotype is “...a fixed, over generalized belief about a particular group or class of people.” (Cardwell, 1996). 

    For example, a “hells angel” biker dresses in leather.
    
    One advantage of a stereotype is that it enables us to respond rapidly to situations because we may have had a similar experience before.
    
    One disadvantage is that it makes us ignore differences between individuals; therefore we think things about people that might not be true (i.e. make generalizations).
    
    The use of stereotypes is a major way in which we simplify our social world; since they reduce the amount of processing (i.e. thinking) we have to do when we meet a new person.
    
    By stereotyping we infer that a person has a whole range of characteristics and abilities that we assume all members of that group have. Stereotypes lead to social categorization, which is one of the reasons for prejudice attitudes (i.e. “them” and “us” mentality) which leads to in-groups and out-groups.
    
    Most stereotypes probably tend to convey a negative impression.  Positive examples would include judges (the phrase “sober as a judge” would suggest this is a stereotype with a very respectable set of characteristics), overweight people (who are often seen as “jolly”) and television news readers (usually seen as highly dependable, respectable and impartial).  Negative stereotypes seem far more common, however.`
